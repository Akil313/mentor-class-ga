# About

A novel approach to the selection process for genetic algorithms

Paper: [A Leveled Mentorship Approach to Genetic Algoritms for the Travelling Salesman Problem](AH_A_Leveled_Mentorship_Approach_to_Genetic_Algorithms_for_the_Travelling_Salesman_Problem.pdf)

# Running the Project

To run this project first you must download a tsp file and matching tour file from [Waterloo's VLSI Dataset](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/vlsi/index.html)

Then execute the mentor-ga.py file

`python mentor-ga.py {path-to-tsp-file}`

Where {path-to-tsp-file is the relative path to the tsp file}

IMPORTANT: The tsp file and tour file should be in the same location
